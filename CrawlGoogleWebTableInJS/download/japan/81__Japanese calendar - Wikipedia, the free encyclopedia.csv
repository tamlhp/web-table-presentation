English name,Common Japanese name,Traditional Japanese name
January,一月 (ichigatsu),"Mutsuki (睦月?, ""Month of Affection"")."
February,二月 (nigatsu),"Kisaragi (如月?) or Kinusaragi (衣更着?, ""Changing Clothes"")."
March,三月 (sangatsu),"Yayoi (弥生?, ""New Life"")."
April,四月 (shigatsu),"Uzuki (卯月?, ""u-no-hana month"")., The u-no-hana (卯の花) is a flower, of the genus Deutzia."
May,五月 (gogatsu),"Satsuki (皐月?) or Sanaetsuki (早苗月?, ""Early-rice-planting Month"")."
June,六月 (rokugatsu),"Minazuki(水無月?, ""Month of Water""). The 無 character, which normally means ""absent"" or ""there is no"", is here ateji, that is, used only for the sound ""na"". In this name the na is actually a possessive particle, so 'minazuki' means ""month of water"", not ""month without water"", and this is in reference to the flooding of the rice fields, which require large quantities of water."
July,七月 (shichigatsu),"Fumizuki(文月?, ""Month of Books"")."
August,八月 (hachigatsu),"Hazuki (葉月?, ""Month of Leaves""). In old Japanese, the month was called 葉落ち月 (Haochizuki, or ""Month of Falling Leaves"")."
September,九月 (kugatsu),"Nagatsuki (長月?, ""The Long Month"")."
October,十月 (jūgatsu),"Kannazuki or Kaminazuki (神無月, ""Month of the Gods""). The 無 character, which normally means ""absent"" or ""there is not"", was here probably originally used as ateji, that is used only for the sound ""na"". In this name the na is actually a possessive particle, so Kaminazuki means ""Month of the Gods"", not ""Month without Gods"" (Kaminakizuki), similarly to Minatsuki, the ""Month of Water""., However, by false etymology this became commonly interpreted to mean that because in that month all the Shinto kami gather at Izumo Shrine shrine in Izumo province (modern-day Shimane Prefecture), there are no gods in the rest of the country. Thus in Izumo Province, the month is called Kamiarizuki (神有月 or 神在月?, ""Month with Gods""). This interpretation is the one commonly cited in western works., Various other etymologies have also been suggested from time to time."
November,十一月 (jūichigatsu),"Shimotsuki (霜月?, ""Month of Frost"")."
December,十二月 (jūnigatsu),"Shiwasu (師走?, ""Priests Running""). This is in reference to priests being busy at the end of the year for New Year's preparations and blessings."
